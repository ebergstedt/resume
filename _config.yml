          This is a demo project for implementing Protobuf, the serialization format developed by Google. It has a wrapper, is well documented and is useful for compression for any type of data. ProtoBuf is designed for unprecedented speed of deserialization, with a very compact format.

          Helper library for .NET MemoryCache with generics, easy initialization and deferred methods if key data is not found. Very useful for keeping data in-memory for fast access without saving it to a database.

          Project leading role in fintech. Took initiative to lift a legacy debt collection system to a modern standard. Implementation included Big Data, event-focused microservice-oriented architecture, cloud hosting and devops restructuring. Results included 90% less time to production, 90-99% query time delay reduction for end consumers, and 70% cost reduction in relation to the legacy hosting with increased on-demand scalability.
